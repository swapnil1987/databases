# Databases


This is my attempt to keep track of all interesting databases I come across. Over time as I will add more information, I will try to classify to the best of my abilities. Right now, there are two broad classifications.

- Databases based on research papers
- Other databases


## Databases based on research papers

2. *Financial Stress and Economic Activity: Evidence from a New Worldwide Index, IMF Working Paper, Ahir et al., 2023*
    - This paper uses text analysis to construct a continuous financial stress index (FSI) for 110 countries over each quarter during the period 1967-2018.
