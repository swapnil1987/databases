# Databases


This is my attempt to keep track of all interesting databases I come across. Over time as I will add more information, I will try to classify to the best of my abilities. Right now, there are two broad classifications.

- Databases based on research papers
- Other databases


## Databases based on research papers


1. Fragmentation and Commodity Markets, IMF Working Paper 2023 
    - dataset of production and bilateral trade flows of the 48 most important energy, mineral and agricultural commodities.
